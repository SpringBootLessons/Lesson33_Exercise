# Exercise: Sending an Email Using Gmail with Spring Boot - Simple Email 

* Create a Spring Boot project that gets an email subject and body message as input from the user.
* Using that input, generate a simple email to send to the JavaMailTestMC@gmail.com inbox.

Note: At this point, it is not necessary to worry about the formatting of text in the email that gets generated. Use plain text only.
